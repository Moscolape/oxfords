          Our General Philosophy
        </h2>
        <h3 style="color: white; text-align:center">Our General Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
          <b>1.) </b>We believe that the
          <b>Oxfords International School</b> makes an important contribution to
          the fundamental education status, moral and spiritual well-being of
          the Aba people. We believe that to continue to serve the community, we
          must be willing to modify, adapt and create opportunities that meet
          the ever-changing needs of students.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>2.) </b>We believe that it is our role to help students to learn to
          think independently, value logical and tested conclusions, develop
          problem-solving abilities, communicate well and function effectively
          with other people. We believe in the dignity and worth of the
          individual child and therefore provide educational opportunities
          regadless of age, economic or social background, or enrolment status.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>3.) </b>We believe that for continued growth, we must display the
          ability to be creative, strive for excellence and to exhibit
          leadership in the expansion of knowledge and skills through the
          achievements of staff and students.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>4.) </b>We hope to develop in our students the desire to continue
          their education throughout their lives. <b>Oxfords'</b> concern is its
          students and as such, this concern is reflected primarily through
          offering programmes of substantial quality with expectation that
          students will achieve a high level of competence and understanding in
          an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>5.) </b>At <b>Oxfords</b>, though standards are high, there's a
          unique emphasis placed upon a child's effort and personal achievement,
          hence, allowing everyone to be a winner. All <b>Oxfords</b> policies
          and schedules ae tailored to the needs of the children on individual
          basis.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>6.) Excellence, Dedication, and Discipline</b> live and breathe as
          the basis of education at <b>Oxfords</b>. These three words are
          incorporated into every aspect of <b>Oxfords</b> academic and
          non-academic programmes.
